<h4>I choose YouTube because it is a great website to use to be informed and entertained. This website has a huge scope of contents from educational to entertainment.
    It is also a great help for me to know the step by step process of something. Also, some teachers posted their videos discussing their lesson that would be beneficial for students.
    Through YouTube, it is now easy to access videos according to what are we interested in.

<h4>I love to use Instagram because I can get to share just my pictures and videos. I personally don't like to share my opinion in public, therefore, I just like to take and look to pictures.
    Also, I can be able to see the updates of my favorite celebrities. As I browse in this website, I can see creative ideas captured and best photos and videos. 
    It is a fun to explore and discover new things.
